### Project Title: Bikeshare


### Description:
This project will read in user input regarding bike share data in a particular city (Chicago, New York, or Washington, D.C.).

### Files used:
bikeshare.py - *main file*  
washington.csv

### Credits:
Project was inspired by the *Programming for Data Science with Python* degree program at Udacity.
